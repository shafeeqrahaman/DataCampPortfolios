In the Analyze International Debt Statistics project, you'll investigate international debt data collected by The World Bank, a global organization that funds countries to manage their economies. You're going to reveal some interesting facts and figures, including:

* The number of countries with debt
* The total amount of debt owed by all the countries
* The country with the highest debt and the amount of its debt
* The average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators
* The most common debt indicator
